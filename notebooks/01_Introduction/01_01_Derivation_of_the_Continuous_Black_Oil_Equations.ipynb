                "The black-oil equations constitute the most widely used flow model in the simulation of hydrocarbon reservoirs. The derivation below is from \\cite{rasmussen2021open}. The model is based on the premise that we have three different fluid phases (aqueous, oleic, and gaseous), and three (pseudo) components: water, oil, and gas. Oil and gas are not single hydrocarbon species, but represent all hydrocarbon species that exist in liquid and vapor form at surface conditions. Mixing is allowed, in the sense that both oil and gas can be found in the oleic phase, in the gaseous phase, or in both. The amount of dissolved gas in the oleic phase and vaporized oil in the gaseous phase must be kept track of on a grid cell basis. In the following discussions the subscripts: $ w $ represents the water, $ o $ the oil, and $ g $ the gas quantities related to each of the phases or components.\n",
