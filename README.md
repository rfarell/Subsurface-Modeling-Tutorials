# Reservoir Simulation and Reduced Order Modeling Tutorial

## Background

Reservoir simulations are instrumental in deciphering the dynamic behavior of oil and gas reservoirs. By leveraging these simulations, we can optimize production strategies and ensure maximum resource recovery.

This tutorial takes inspiration from a notable study presented by Aziz S. Odeh in 1981, which delved into solutions for a three-dimensional black-oil reservoir simulation problem.

## Open Porous Media (OPM) Simulator

To navigate through this challenge, we employ the Open Porous Media (OPM) Simulator, a powerful tool designed for reservoir simulations.
